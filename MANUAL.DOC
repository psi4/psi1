      PSI is a state-of-the-art suite of computer programs for the ab           
 initio quantum mechanical prediction of molecular structure, molecular         
 spectra, molecular properties, and chemical reactivity.  These programs        
 have been under development in the research group of Professor H. F.           
 Schaefer III since 1969, first at the University of California,                
 Berkeley, later at the University of Texas, Austin, and now at the

                STOP!   DO  NOT  SKIP  OVER  THIS  SECTION!                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
     Now that we have your attention...  PSI is a very flexible                 
 collection of programs but it can also be intimidating to the first time       
 user.  There are many choices and numerous options.  Most of these             
 options you will not use (and may not even want to know about) in the          
 beginning.  These pages describe how to do the most common types of            
 calculations. In addition, some recommendations on wavefunction                
 convergence and a short list of common errors are given.                       
                                                                                
                                                                                
 1.  Take a look now at the input deck shown at the end of this chapter.        
 Only minor modifications of this "super input deck" are required to run        
 energies and gradients for SCF, CI and CC wavefunctions.  We suggest           
 you make a copy of an input deck like this for yourself, and then make         
 the following changes to it when you want to do calculations on some           
 new molecule.                                                                  
                                                                                
 2. Getting started                                                             
 Every study begins with the specification of a filename, the atoms             
 in the molecule, the basis set associated with each set of atoms,              
 and the point group symmetry of the molecule.  These are defined in            
 the FILES and INPUT section.  As far as PSI is concerned, once these           
 parameters are specified we may choose to determine any type of                
 wavefunction and associated energy, or any derivative of that                  
 wavefunction that is compatible with the capablities of PSI, simply            
 by changing some parameters in subsequent sections.  To begin, then,           
 you should do the following:                                                   
                                                                                
      In the # FILES ## section, change CH2O to your filename.                  
      In the # INPUT ## section, change CNV to your symmetry point group.       
 Change the atoms and the Cartesian coordinates to correspond to your           
 molecule.  Change the basis set (GET DZ, etc.) to your basis set (see          
 Chapter V for details).                                                        
      Now run INPUT.  A file called SLOFILE is generated.  Edit this file       
 and check that you have the correct number of basis functions, total           
 number of atoms, and so on.                                                    
                                                                                
 3. SCF energy                                                                  
 Only four of the many options are routinely used here, and those are           
 the ones that specify the wavefuntion convergence, the number of open          
 shells, the flag to tell PSI whether to use a previous vector to aid           
 in SCF convergence, and the maximum number of SCF iterations.  Below           
 the options line, we must specify the orbital occupations by symmetry          
 type and include a set of coupling coefficients if the electronic              
 state is not closed shell. Finally, if open shell states or TCSCF is           
 being used, then one should consider changing the DAMP and DAM1                
 options from their standard values of 0.0 and 1.0 to aid in the SCF            
 convergence. (WARNING: Please read the section entitled "Hints on              
 Converging the SCF" in the detailed description of the SCF program             
 in Chapter V before attempting open shell or TCSCF calculations).              
                                                                                
      Thus, in the # SCF #### section, set the second option to an              
 appropriate value for the SCF convergence,  set the third option (IOPEN)       
 according to your wavefunction (closed shell = 0, open shell = 1,              
 TCSCF = 2). Set the fourth option = 1 if you have a previous guess             
 vector (else = 0).  Set the tenth option to a reasonable number for the        
 maximum number of SCF iterations. Put in the orbital occupation numbers.       
 Add coupling coefficients if you are not doing a closed shell molecule.        
 Change DAMP and DAM1 if necessary.                                             
      Now you can calculate the SCF energy.  Check the output to make           
 sure you have the correct electronic state and that the SCF converged.         
                                                                                
 4. SCF optimization                                                            
 With the molecular geometry, point group symmetry, atomic basis sets           
 and electronic states defined as in sections 2 and 3 above, the                
 additional modifications required to obtain the derivative of the              
 SCF energy with respect to nuclear coordinates for use in geometry             
 optimization are:                                                              
                                                                                
      Modify the # DERIV ##, # INTCOS # and # GNEXTS # sections for your        
 molecule according to the descriptions in Chapter V.                           
      Now you can run the SCF derivative and geometry optimization              
 sequence of programs.  If you want to use the B-matrix program, set up         
 the file called BMAT as in the example at the end of this chapter.             
                                                                                
 5. SCF vibrational frequencies                                                 
      In the # DERIV ## section, change FIRST to SECOND.                        
      In the # NORMCO # section, change the third option to the number of       
 degrees of freedom of your molecule.                                           
      Now you can calculate second derivatives and vibrational                  
 frequencies.  If you want to use the INTDER program, set up a file             
 called INTDER1 as in the example at the end of this chapter.                   
                                                                                
 6. CISD energy                                                                 
 To perform a standard CISD calculation, only the input in the DRT              
 section needs to be modified.  For the example we have shown here, the         
 number of irreducible reps is 4 and the number of basis functions is 60.       
 These need to be changed for your molecule.  You also need to specify          
 how many molecular orbitals are frozen, how many occupied, and how many        
 unoccupied in the CI treatment.  Thus, with the molecular geometry,            
 point group symmetry, atomic basis sets and electronic states defined          
 as in sections 2 and 3 above, CISD energies may be obtained as follows:        
                                                                                
      In the # DRT #### section, modify the number of irreducible reps          
 and number of basis functions for your molecule.  Put in the appropriate       
 orbital codes (see Chapter V).                                                 
      Now you can calculate the CISD energy.                                    
                                                                                
 7. CI optimization                                                             
 With the molecular geometry, point group symmetry, atomic basis sets           
 and electronic states defined as in sections 2 and 3 above, the                
 coordinates defined either in the # INTCOS # and # GNEXTS # sections           
 or in the BMAT file as in section 4 above, and the correct # DRT ####          
 input as in section 6 above, the additional modifications required             
 to optimize the geometry with a CISD wavefunction are:                         
                                                                                
      In the # MASTER # section, change it to read GRSCF  CI  FIRST.            
      In the # DRT #### section, change any FZC to COR, and FZV to VIR.         
      Now you can run CI gradients and the geometry optimization programs.      
                                                                                
 8. Coupled Cluster energy                                                      
 With the molecular geometry, point group symmetry, atomic basis sets           
 and electronic states defined as in sections 2 and 3 above, CCSD               
 energies may be obtained as follows:                                           
                                                                                
      In the # CCSD ### section, modify the number of core and virtual          
 orbitals for your molecule, and set the first option of the second             
 line of options to an appropriate value for the energy convergence             
 (7 in the example we have shown here).                                         
      Now you can calculate the CCSD energy (closed shell systems only).        
                                                                                
 9. CC optimization                                                             
 With the molecular geometry, point group symmetry, atomic basis sets           
 and electronic states defined as in sections 2 and 3 above, the                
 coordinates defined either in the # INTCOS # and # GNEXTS # sections           
 or in the BMAT file as in section 4 above, and the modification to             
 # MASTER # described in section 7 above, additional changes needed to          
 perform a CCSD optimization are:                                               
                                                                                
      In the # CCSD ### section, set the numbers of core and virtual            
 orbitals to zero, and give an appropriate value for energy convergence.        
      In the # DRT #### section, set the input up as though the                 
 molecule had no symmetry and no frozen orbitals.  That is, set the             
 number of irreducible representations = 1, and then give the number of         
 DOC and UOC orbitals.                                                          
      In the # LAGTR ## and # GRCPHF # sections, change the third options       
 to 1.                                                                          
      In the # ZCCSD ## section, give an appropriate value for the              
 convergence of the coupled-perturbed CCSD equations (9 in the example          
 we have shown here).                                                           
      Now you can run a CCSD gradient and optimize the geometry.                
                                                                                
                                                                                
 See Chapter V for more details on the input required for all these             
 programs.                                                                      
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
 Recommendations on Wavefunction Convergence:                                   
      Possibly THE single greatest waste of time in the use of                  
 ab-initio quantum chemistry programs is the over-convergence of the            
 wavefunction.  If all you want to know is the energy at a single point,        
 converging the density matrix to twelve decimal places is a tremendous         
 waste of time, particularly for open-shell or TCSCF wavefunctions              
 which converge so slowly and require lots of I/O.  Of course, the more         
 you plan to do with the SCF wavefunction, the more accuracy is needed.         
 Thus, if you plan to determine any derivatives, or transform the               
 MO's for use in a correlated energy calculation, then ten or more              
 decimal places may be required to achieve the desired accuracy in              
 the final result.  On the other hand, in the initial stages of a               
 geometry optimization of a molecule less accuracy is required, and             
 the wise user will take this into account, and will increase the               
 wavefunction convergence as the structure nears equilibrium.  These            
 comments are especially appropriate for investigations at correlated           
 levels of theory.                                                              
       With this in mind, we recommend the following:                           
 A) for single-point energies, or initial stages of geometry                    
    optimizations, converge the SCF to 10**-8, or 10**-9.                       
 B) for single-point CISD, CCSD, or CCSDT-1 energies, or during                 
    initial stages of geometry optimization, convergence of the                 
    correlated density matrix to 10**-6, or 10**-7 is sufficient.               
 C) for optimized geometries, converge the SCF to 10**-10, and                  
    the correlated density matrix to 10**-8.                                    
 D) If vibrational frequencies will be computed, converge the                   
    SCF to 10**-10,or 10**-11, and all correlated energy                        
    density matrices to 10**-9, or 10**-10.                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
 List of common errors:                                                         
   - wrong SCF energy                                                           
     Solution: check the electronic state.  Modify the orbital occupation       
     numbers if necessary.  Maybe reorder the eigenvectors.                     
                                                                                
   - wrong coordinates in BMAT file                                             
     Solution: check coordinates carefully.  Make sure they transform           
     correctly under the various symmetry operations.  Only use the             
     totally symmetric ones for optimizations.                                  
                                                                                
   - geometry in FILE30 does not match the specified symmetry                   
     Solution: the geometry updating procedure has probably gone wrong.         
     Check it carefully.  Make sure the coordinates in the BMAT file are        
     correct.

1        IV.    Order of programs required to run a calculation                 
         ======================================================                 
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
     PSI is a package of separated programs, in contrast to some other          
 ab initio packages which consist of just one very large piece of code.         
 This means that, whereas with some packages one can run one program            
 to do everything, with the approach used here one needs to run a               
 sequence of programs in a particular order (using, for example, a              
 macro procedure).  This segmentation of the code results in maximum            
 flexibility for developing new algorithms and applying them to difficult       
 problems.  It is very easy to run an isolated part of the package if           
 various files have been kept from earlier stages of the calculation.           
 This chapter describes the different types of calculations that can be         
 performed with PSI, and the particular subset of programs required             
 for each calculation.                                                          
                                                                                
                                                                                
 a.  Preliminary                                                                
     -----------                                                                
                                                                                
     There are three programs (INPUT, ZMAT and GEOMIU) that are used to         
     set up the basis set and geometry information.                             
                                                                                
       INPUT     This is the first program that must be run when a set          
                 of calculations is begun on a molecule.  This creates a        
                 binary file called FILE30 (see Apendices for a                 
                 discussion of filenaming conventions) which is the             
                 starting point for all the other programs.                     
                 If it is desired to change either the basis set or the         
                 symmetry of the molecule then INPUT must be run again.         
                 Normally, if one were doing, say, a geometry                   
                 optimization, frequency calculation and single point           
                 energies for a particular conformation with a particular       
                 basis set then INPUT would only be run once at the very        
                 beginning.                                                     
                                                                                
       ZMAT                                                                     
       GEOMIU    These two programs may be used at any point in the             
                 calculation to update the geometry in the file called          
                 FILE30.                                                        
                 Note that ZMAT does not actually alter FILE30;                 
                 it simply takes a set of internal coordinates (in              
                 Pople-like Z-Matrix format) and writes the corresponding       
                 Cartesian coordinates to the bottom of the file called         
                 INPUT.  (See Chapter V for more details.)                      
                 GEOMIU can be used in conjunction with the ZMAT program,       
                 or with other programs that write Cartesian coordinates        
                 to the INPUT file, or indeed with a set of Cartesian           
                 coordinates that the user has typed in by hand, to             
                 update the geometry in the binary file, FILE30.                
                                                                                
                                                                                
     In the ensuing sections, it is assumed that the program INPUT has          
     already been run and that a file called FILE30 exists.

       closed shell TCSCF energy of a molecule by setting the                   
       appropriate options in the input for the SCF program (see

     In calculating the analytic second derivatives, one has the                
     choice of using the supermatrix (PK-file) formulation or not.              
     Use of the supermatrix is normally the desired method as it                
     speeds up the solution of the coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock (CPHF)        
     equations, however it does require some extra disk space.

     Each of these methods basically consist of a loop through gradient,        
     optimization, and updating routines.  Because of the separated             
     nature of the programs, there is no easy way at the moment to              
     automatically stop the optimization when a certain threshold has           
     been attained.  Therefore, user interaction is usually required to         
     determine if convergence has been reached.                                 
                                                                                
     WARNING: Use of the programs GUESSSCF and GUESSCI is only permitted       |
              for experienced PSI users!  In general, it is much safer         |
              to do one cycle of an optimization and then carefully            |
              check the energy, the gradients, the choice of coordinates,      |
              and the geometry update, before sending the programs off         |
              into the wilderness.                                             |

 m.  Calculating frequencies and derivatives from finite displacements          
     -----------------------------------------------------------------          
                                                                                
     Numerical second derivatives can be obtained through finite                
     displacement of analytic first derivatives.  In a similar way,             
     numerical third derivatives can be obtained from analytic second           
     derivatives, and so on.                                                    
     Two very common uses of these procedures are a) to calculate CI or         
     CC frequencies, and b) to obtain SCF fourth derivatives for an             
     anharmonic analysis.                                                       
                                                                                
     The user may choose to perform the finite displacements in either          
     Cartesian or internal coordinates.  These methods are described            
     separately below.

     *********************                                                      
                                                                                
     i)  To carry out finite displacements of first derivatives in              
         Cartesian coordinates, proceed as follows:                             
                                                                                
         A. Set up the reference geometry in Cartesian coordinates at the       
            bottom of the file called INPUT using the format appropriate        
            for the GEOMIU program.                                             
            Generate the displaced geometries by hand by adding and             
            subtracting values to the 3N Cartesian coordinates.  Do this        
            only for the symmetry unique coordinates.  (In the case of          
            H2O, there will be seven displacements.  No out-of-plane            
            displacements are required.  See the Examples.)                     
            A recommended value for the displacement is 0.01 bohr.              
            The displaced geometries will not be all of the same                
            symmetry.  They should be grouped according to their point          
            group and a different INPUT deck and corresponding FILE30           
            generated for each symmetry. (In the case of H2O, two               
            displacements will be C2v symmetry and the remaining five           
            will be Cs symmetry.)                                               
                                                                                
         B. Loop over the following programs n times, where n is the            
            number of displacements.                                            
                                                                                
            +->GEOMIU        Updates FILE30 to the displaced geometry

            The derivatives (in Cartesian coordinates) are accumulated          
            in FILE11.  The geometry at the top of FILE11 should                
            correspond to the original (undisplaced) geometry.                  
            (This loop will usually have to be performed separately for         
            each symmetry group of displacements (for example, C2v and Cs       
            in the case of H2O) and the resulting FILE11s concatenated.)        
                                                                                
         C. Run either   VIBLRG   or   FORM15                                   
                                                                                
            This will generate a file called FILE15 containing the second       
            derivatives in Cartesian coordinates.  The input for these          
            programs is described in Chapter V.  With FILE15 in place,          
            vibrational analysis using either NORMCO or INTDER may be           
            performed (see section l.).                                         
                                                                                
     ii) The procedure for obtaining third and fourth derivatives from          
         finite displacements of analytic second and third derivatives is       
         similar to the above.

         After modifying TOTAL15 and TOTAL20 according to the input             
         descriptions in Chapter V,

     iii)To obtain dipole moment derivatives in Cartesian coordinates           
         from finite displacements of dipole moments,

     i)  The procedure for obtaining second derivatives from finite             
         displacements of first derivatives in internal coordinates is          
         as follows:                                                            
         (this is a little complicated, so find yourself a nice quiet           
         spot where you won't be disturbed, take a deep breath,                 
         and read on...)                                                        
                                                                                
         A. Set up the geometry and internal coordinates in the file            
            called BMAT.  (Note that you will need all 3N-6 coordinates         
            if you wish to calculate all the frequencies.)                      
            Generate the displacements with the BMATIN6 program (see the        
            input description in Chapter V for more details).                   
            Recommended values for the displacements are 0.005 Angstrom         
            for stretches and 0.01 radian for angles.                           
            You will need +ve and -ve displacements for those coordinates       
            belonging to the totally symmetric irreducible representation       
            of the point group, and only +ve displacements for all the          
            rest  (for the asymmetric coordinates, the -ve displacements        
            can be generated by symmetry operations of the point group).        
                                                                                
            The displaced geometries in Cartesian coordinates are written       
            in sequence to the bottom of INPUT.  These geometries should        
            be grouped according to their symmetry point group and a            
            different INPUT and FILE30 generated for each symmetry.             
                                                                                
            (For example, H2O has two symmetrized coordinates of A1             
            symmetry (the symmetric stretch and the bend) and one of B2         
            symmetry (the asymmetric stretch).  A total of five                 
            displacements are required: two for each of the two A1              
            coordinates, and one for the B2 coordinate.  The A1                 
            displacements will be C2v symmetry, the B2 displacement Cs          
            symmetry.  Thus, two INPUTs and two FILE30s will be                 
            required.)                                                          
                                                                                
         B. Loop over the following programs n times, where n is the            
            number of displacements.

            The derivatives (in Cartesian coordinates) are accumulated

            correspond to the original (undisplaced) geometry.

            where n is the number of displacements.                             
                                                                                
              Run INTDER                                                        
                                                                                
            This will generate a file called FILE12 containing all the          
            first derivatives in internal coordinates.                          
                                                                                
         D. Rename FILE12 to FILE12A and modify according to the input          
            description for the INTDIF program in Chapter V (see the            
            subsection entitled "Information required in FILE12A").             
                                                                                
              Run INTDIF                                                        
                                                                                
            This will generate a file called IDER containing the non-zero       
            first and second derivatives in internal coordinates (also          
            some diagonal third derivatives).                                   
                                                                                
         E. Finally, set up the input for the INTDER program with the           
            option NINV=2 and copy the second derivatives from the IDER         
            file into the appropriate place in the input (after the             
            atomic masses).  (Also set the options NDER=2, NEQ=0,               
            NFREQ=1 or 3, MULTI=1.)                                             
                                                                                
              Run INTDER                                                        
                                                                                
            This will generate a file called FILE15 containing the second       
            derivatives in Cartesian coordinates.  The frequencies will         
            be in the output file called INTDERO.                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
     ii) The procedure for obtaining third and fourth derivatives from          
         finite displacements of analytic second and third derivatives is       
         similar to the above.  Since the second and third derivatives in       
         Cartesian coordinates are not accumulated automatically, one           
         solution is to run INTDER after each displacement and accumulate       
         the internal coordinate derivatives:

         (The input for INTDER should have the options NDER=2 or 3,             
         NEQ=1, NINV=0, MULTI=0.)                                               
         After modifying FILE12A, FILE16A and FILE21A according to the          
         input description for the INTDIF program, one should then              
         proceed with steps D. and E. above.  (In step E., NDER should be       
         set to 3 or 4.)                                                        
                                                                                
     iii)To obtain dipole moment derivatives in internal coordinates from       
         finite displacements of dipole moments, at present one must do         
         the calculation by hand.  (Note: in order to obtain correct            
         infrared intensities, you must use the atomic masses in the BMAT       
         file when generating the displacements using the BMATIN6               
         program.  This ensures that the Eckart conditions are satisfied        
         (see Wilson, Decius and Cross "Molecular Vibrations" (1955),           
         Section 11-1).)                                                        
         For a symmetric coordinate, S, the derivative is given by

         For an asymmetric coordinate, S, the derivative is given by

         These derivatives should be placed in FILE18 or in the file            
         called INTDER1 according to the input description for INTDER.          
         The program INTDER should then be run to obtain infrared               
         intensities (NFREQ=1, IRINT=1).

     This chapter provides details about each of the programs available         
 in the PSI package.  For each program, the description is broken into          
 four parts:

 In part C., the files used by each program are identified by their             
 generic filetype (or file extension).  For example, FILE6 or FILE30.           
 The full names of the files would be (under IBM VM/CMS):                       
     filename FILE6                                                             
     filename FILE30                                                            
 and so on.  The only exception is 'BASIS DATA', which is the full name         
 of the file containing the standard basis sets used by the program             
 called INPUT.                                                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
 In part D., the input is listed as follows:

     There are a number of places in this chapter where options are             
 listed that are not presently available.  These are planned for use in         
 future, more advanced versions of the programs.

     Unless otherwise stated, the input for all the programs is read            
     from a file called (under IBM VM/CMS)                                      
                                                                                
         filename INPUT                                                         
                                                                                
     where 'filename' is something meaningful to the user.                      
                                                                                
     The data in the INPUT file is separated into sections with each            
     section being delimited by a flag of the form                              
         # name #      (format A10)                                             
     For example, the input section for the program DERIV begins                
     with the line                                                              
         # DERIV ##                                                             
     (i.e. one '#', one space, the name, one space, then enough '#'s to         
     round it out to ten characters.  You MUST use ten characters,              
     otherwise the flag will not be matched.  You can type anything you         
     like beyond the tenth position.)                                           
     The various sections in the INPUT file may be in any order.

     Each program needs to know where to read and store its information         
     (in binary form).  This is achieved through the use of the                 
     # FILES ## section.

     This input section is required for (almost) every program.  The            
     binary files (FILE30 - FILE99) produced by each program will be            
     called (under IBM VM/CMS):

  A. INPUT is a preliminary program which reads the input data for the          
     molecule (geometry, basis set, etc. ) and generates a working file         
     called FILE30 which is the real starting point of each calculation.        
     INPUT can handle a total of 50 atoms, 120 unique shells, and 360           
     primitive gaussian functions.  INPUT limits the use of symmetry            
     point groups to D2h and its subgroups.

  A. SCF carries out the iterative procedure to solve the                       
     Hartree-Fock equations.                                                    
                                                                                
     Note:                                                                      
         Since these programs are restricted to D2h symmetry and its subgroups, 
     and the orbital occupations are required to be integers, certain pure      
     angular momentum states derived from partial occupation of degenerate      
     orbitals cannot be obtained with the present codes.  For example, the      
     2PIu (doublet PI u) state of linear O-N-O derived from the lowest energy   
     linear (pi u)1 configuration may only be computed as the 2B2u (doublet     
     B 2u) or 2B3u (doublet B 3u) component of the 2PIu (doublet PI u) state,   
     and the resulting spatial wavefunction will not have PI symmetry.  In a    
     certain sense, however, this is desirable, as the energy will be a         
     continuous function of the bending angle.  Calculating the energy of       
     bent configurations as 2B2u (doublet B 2u) or 2B3u (doublet B 3u) and      
     doing a pure 2PIu (doublet PI u) state at linear geometries results in     
     a pronounced discontinuity.                                                
         For the most part, triplet states resulting from double occupation     
     of a doubly degenerate orbital, such as the 3A2 (triplet A 2) state        
     resulting from the (e')2 or (e")2 configurations in D3h symmetry, or       
     the 3SIGMAg (triplet SIGMA g) state of a (pi g)2 or (pi u)2 configuration  
     in Dinfh (D infinity h) symmetry, will have the proper spatial symetry.    
     The singlet states resulting from these same electronic configurations     
     are inherently multiconfiguration and, as such, are not well represented   
     by single configuration wavefunctions.

         In the present version of the program, the number printed out          
     as the "VIRIAL THEOREM" is incorrectly calculated and should be            
     ignored.  Don't be put off by this; everything else is OK!

         INLFG option:  For difficult open shell cases, it is recommended       
     that an appropriate closed shell calculation be run first (add or          
     remove an extra electron) and that this SCF vector then be used as         
     a guess (INFLG = 1) for the desired open shell wavefunction.  For          
     TCSCF cases, it is always wise to run a closed shell (or perhaps           
     the appropriate triplet) SCF first and then use this as a guess for        
     the TCSCF.                                                                 
                                                                                
         Level shifting:  For open shell systems, a level shift value of        
     0.5 to 3.0 is recommended.  Start with a high value (2.0 - 3.0)            
     for the first SCF calculation and then reduce it (to 0.5 - 1.0)            
     for subsequent runs which use a converged SCF vector as the                
     starting point.

  A. Distinct Row Table program for the shape driven GUGA CI system.            
     This program will read a flexible input format of orbital codes,           
     rearrange the orbitals to a form suitable for the CI and generate          
     all the arrays needed to describe the CI calculation and the               
     integral storage.                                                          
     The CI program can handle arbitrary reference sets, arbitrary              
     excitation levels, and reference sets such as triples in a selected        
     space and, say, singles outside that space.  There is essentially no       
     limit to the total number of unpaired electrons, orbitals or               
     configurations except for the computer time available.

     constructed using the shape driven graphical unitary group                 
     approach for CISD.  For higher excitations, the loop driven GUGA           
     approach is used.  The Davidson correction is also calculated              
     (note, however, that the value printed out for the Davidson                
     correction is only correct for one reference CISD wavefunctions).

  A. NCC9 calculates the closed shell coupled-cluster energy.                   
                                                                                
     CCSD is (2 to 8 times) more expensive than CISD.  The gradient time        
     overhead is about 100% of the energy time.                                 
     CCSDT-1 calculations are expensive.  They scale as N (the number of        
     basis functions) to the seventh power, one order of magnitude bigger       
     than CCSD.  The gradient time overhead is about 200%.                      
     Savings in CC are non-linear with respect to the number of                 
     irreducible representations, i.e. the higher your symmetry point           
     group, the more you save.

  A. FORM37 reads the integral file (FILE34) and forms a supermatrix            
     integral file (FILE37) for PEMSCF second and third derivatives.            
     This version does not take into account any symmetry, but                  
     eliminates P and Q when they are smaller than a threshold.                 
     The maximum number of basis functions is 125.

  A. BMWRTA takes the geometry and gradients from the bottom of FILE11          
     and writes them into the BMAT file in the appropriate place                
     (i.e. after the option lines).  The old Cartesian coordinates and          
     forces in the BMAT file are overwritten.  Thus, the easiest way to         
     set up a virginal BMAT file is to leave 2N blank lines after the           
     options, where N is the number of atoms.

  A. BMATIN6 is an extensively modified version of Prof. Peter Pulay's          
     "BMAT" program.  BMATIN6 also incorporates the eigenvector following       
     routine OPTEFC of Dr. Jon Baker.                                           
                                                                                
     Notes on the B-matrix program:                                             
       The main tasks performed by BMATIN6 are:                                 
                                                                                
       1.  Geometry optimizations can be carried out completely in              
       internal coordinates.  BMATIN6 takes Cartesian geometries and            
       energy gradients and transforms these to internal coordinates and        
       internal forces.  The user also supplies an initial-guess force          
       constant matrix in internal coordinates.  This can be built up           
       from values found in the literature for previous calculations or         
       for experiments.  Alternatively, a set of force constants from a         
       small basis set calculation can be used.  The force constants are        
       updated using various Hessian update methods:                            
        a) Powell (symmetric Broyden), which does not enforce positive          
           definiteness.                                                        
           This is the default for transition structures.                       
        b) Davidon-Fletcher-Powell                                              
        c) The variable metric method of Murtaugh and Sargent.                  
        d) Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), which is usually            
           the best for equilibrium geometries.                                 
           This is the default for minima.                                      
       New internal coordinates are obtained according to the Newton-           
       Raphson scheme and transformed back into Cartesian                       
       coordinates.  These are then appended to the bottom of the file          
       called INPUT in the format appropriate for the GEOMIU program.           
                                                                                
       2.  Cartesian coordinates can be generated for displacements along       
       internal coordinates.  BMATIN6 takes as input the reference              
       geometry in Cartesian coordinates along with the specification           
       of the internal coordinate distortion(s) to be made.  The                
       Cartesian coordinates corresponding to the internal coordinate           
       distortion(s) are appended to the bottom of the file called INPUT.       
       If atomic masses are given, the transformations between Cartesian        
       and internal coordinates will be in accordance with the Eckart           
       conditions (see Wilson, Decius & Cross "Molecular Vibrations"            
       (1955), Section 11-1).  (This is important if displacements of           
       dipole moments are desired.)                                             
                                                                                
       3.  BMATIN6 can be used to simply compute and print the B-matrix         
       which transforms Cartesian coordinates to internal coordinates.          
                                                                                
       Notes:                                                                   
       a.  Geometry optimizations in internal coordinates are always            
           carried out in the totally symmetric irreducible                     
           representation of the point group of the system in question          
           (e.g. A' for Cs, A1 for C2v, Ag for D2h, etc.).  Some of             
           the most frequent causes of error in the use of BMATIN6 are          
           the attempt to use fewer coordinates than there are degrees          
           of freedom, and the use of redundant sets of coordinates.            
           For H2O, it is obvious that there are two A1 coordinates that        
           one would use to optimize the molecule.  For very large              
           systems, however, it is sometimes tedious to work out the            
           number of coordinates of a particular symmetry and some useful       
           time-saving formulas are given in H. H. Jaffe and M. Orchin          
           "Symmetry in Chemistry" (Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1965),        
           Appendix 2.                                                          
           If it is desired to obtain asymmetric displacements then all         
           3N-6 internal coordinates need to be specified.                      
                                                                                
       b.  If an optimization gets bollixed up in any way, it may be that       
           the file called RESUL2 is causing problems.  If the old              
           geometry in RESUL2 and the geometry in BMAT are the same, the        
           Hessian updates will behave badly.  It may be necessary to           
           erase the RESUL2 file and start the update over.                     
                                                                                
       c.  Occasionally problems may arise due to a discontinuity in the        
           definition of an internal coordinate (e.g. a nearly linear           
           angle or out-of-plane angle near 90 degrees).  Solution: try         
           different angle definitions.                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
     Notes on the eigenvector following routine (invoked with the EIGF          
     option):                                                                   
           The eigenvector following routine (OPTEFC) is an efficient           
       quasi-Newton algorithm for locating transition structures.  It           
       was written by Jon Baker as a local addition to the GAUSSIAN 82          
       package in Leo Radom's group.                                            
                                                                                
           The method is based on a modification to the Newton-Raphson          
       step first proposed by Cerjan and Miller <1>, although the major         
       part of the algorithm is based on the later developments of Simons       
       and coworkers <2,3>.  It is capable of locating transition               
       structures even if started in the wrong region of the energy             
       surface, and, by invoking Hessian mode following, can locate             
       several different transition structures from the same initial            
       starting point.                                                          
       It can also be used to locate minima.                                    
                                                                                
           A discussion of the formalism and the ideas behind it,               
       together with a description of the algorithm and some practical          
       examples are given in ref <4>.                                           
                                                                                
                                                                                
       Mode following:                                                          
                                                                                
           For a transition structure search, maximization normally             
       takes place along the lowest mode and minimization along all other       
       modes.  However, as first pointed out by Cerjan and Miller <1>,          
       it is possible to maximize along modes other than the lowest and         
       in this manner obtain transition structures for alternative              
       rearrangements and/or dissociations from the same initial                
       starting point.                                                          
                                                                                
           Mode following is switched on for OPTEFC by means of the MODE        
       option in BMAT.  "MODE     1    n" for a particular variable "n"         
       will cause a transition structure search to follow the Hessian           
       mode with the largest magnitude component for that variable.             
       The idea behind this is that, in many cases, the various Hessian         
       modes are dominated by a single variable corresponding to a large        
       change in a particular bond length or bond angle say, and it is          
       this particular parameter that is required to change the most            
       during a transition structure search.  For example, looking for a        
       dissociation transition structure should involve change in               
       essentially just one parameter - the bond length between the two         
       dissociating moieties - and following the mode with the largest          
       magnitude component for this bond length should have the best            
       chance of leading to the desired transition structure.                   
                                                                                
           This is not always the case however, and specific Hessian            
       modes can be followed without any reference to particular                
       internal variables by using "MODE     0    n", causing the nth           
       mode to be followed.                                                     
                                                                                
           Note that only one mode can be followed at a time.                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
       Error messages and program limitations in OPTEFC:                        
                                                                                
           A maximum of 50 variables can be specified.                          
       A certain amount of input checking is done in the subroutine             
       INITEF and most of the error message printout occurs here.               
       Nothing else should go wrong, although it is theoretically               
       possible for the iterative procedure which calculates the                
       eigenvalue shift parameter lambda in subroutine FORMD to fail.           
       Either the procedure will not converge, in which case the message

       unacceptable value, giving the message

       It is EXTREMELY UNLIKELY for either of these events to occur.            
       If they do, the internal coordinates should be checked carefully;        
       specifying more variables than are allowed for by symmetry may be        
       what is causing the problem.  Also double check that the geometry        
       and forces in the BMAT file have been updated using BMWRTA and           
       that they are different to the "old" ones in RESUL2.                     
       Note that switching on the Newton-Raphson step (setting IOP19=1)         
       obviates the need to calculate a shift parameter, although this          
       can only be used in the right region of the energy surface.

           This line indicates that the nuclear coordinates are to be           
           read in Angstrom units as opposed to atomic units (default).

           If this option is specified, internal coordinate "n" is fixed        
           in the geometry optimization.  To fix more than one coordinate       
           repeat this line as many times as necessary.

           This causes the program to print the B-matrix to the file            
           called RESUL3.

           If this option is present, the input for the specification           
           of the internal coordinates is printed to the main output file       
           (called RESUL1).  The values of the simple internal                  
           coordinates are also printed.

           With this option, the Cartesian forces are read in with units        
           of mdyne.  Keep in mind that the forces in FILE11 are in             
           atomic units, so this option should only be used if the forces       
           are to be typed in by hand.

           If this option is specified, the program reads in internal           
           forces instead of Cartesian forces.  Note the different place        
           where the internal forces are read in: after the specification       
           of the internal coordinates.  The Cartesian forces are read in       
           before the internal coordinates.  The dimensions of the              
           internal forces should be compatible with the energy measured        
           in AJ (=mdyne*A) and with the stretching coordinates measured        
           in Angstrom, bending ones in radian.

           This line indicates that a force constant matrix is to be read       
           in.  The units of the force constants are mdyne/A, mdyne or          
           mdyne*A depending on the type of internal coordinate.                
           If this is the first cycle, the force constant matrix is read        
           in from the BMAT file (see below).                                   
           On subsequent cycles, the force constant matrix and old data         
           (internal coordinates, forces, and displacements) are read in        
           from the file called RESUL2.                                         
           The program keeps track of the number of optimization cycles         
           through the information on the file called RESUL2.  On the           
           first cycle, RESUL2 should contain just one blank line, 132          
           characters long.

           This option supresses the reading in of any information from         
           the file called RESUL2, and the data is read in from the             
           BMAT file instead.

           If this option is specified, Hessian updating is not                 
           performed.  Otherwise, the internal coordinates and forces           
           in the previous step of the geometry optimization are used           
           to improve the force constant matrix using one of the                
           following methods:

           FLT1 specifies that the Fletcher-Powell method of optimization       
           is to be used rather than the variable metric method of              
           Murtagh-Sargent.  With FLT1, the first part of the algorithm         
           is implemented.  The FMAT option must also be specified if the       
           FLT1 option is present.  The ETAn values are steps along the         
           Fletcher-Powell direction vector for which Cartesian                 
           coordinates are desired.  If, for example, only two steps are

           of the ETA value which minimizes the energy along the

               Note :  Setting IOP13 = 2 ensures that the BFGS update           
           (the default update for a minimum search) retains positive           
           definiteness; i.e. if the Hessian before the update has all          
           positive eigenvalues, then so will the updated Hessian.              
           In most cases the BFGS update retains positive definiteness          
           anyway, but this is not guaranteed.  Use of this option will         
           cause the update to be skipped if positive definiteness is           
           endangered.  Thus, once the Hessian becomes positive definite,       
           it will remain so within the limits of numerical rounding            
           error.  Such a feature is, of course, not desirable for a            
           transition structure search, and use of the BFGS update is           
           consequently not recommended when searching for a transition         
           structure.                                                           
                                                                                
               If there is a conflict in the updating methods specified         
           by IOP13 and EXPLICITLY by BMAT, the BMAT option will take           
           precedence.

               If the first number is 0 (default), the second is the            
           number of the Hessian mode (as ordered by eigenvalue) to be          
           followed.  In transition structure searches, the second number       
           is 1 by default (i.e. the lowest mode).                              
               If the first number is 1, the second is the number of the        
           internal coordinate that determines which mode is followed           
           (the mode with the highest component for that internal               
           coordinate).

           This line indicates that the aim of the calculation is not to        
           transform forces but to obtain molecular geometries which are        
           distorted in a prescribed way from the reference geometry.           
           "n" is the number of displacements.  Note that the distortions       
           are exact curvilinear distortions.                                   
           Default units for displacements are Angstrom and radians.            
           For DISP to work correctly, a dummy RESUL2 file is required          
           containing just one blank line, 132 chacters long.

           This option is for use with the DISP option.  It specifies           
           that displacements for bond stretching coordinates are given         
           in bohr rather than Angstrom.  (Units for angular coordinates

         The internal coordinates are defined as follows:                       
         For STRE, the coordinate is the A-B bond distance, and the order       
              of A and B does not matter.                                       
         For INVR, the coordinate is the A-B bond inverse, and the order        
              of A and B does not matter.                                       
         For BEND, it is the A-B-C bond angle.  A and C can be exchanged        
              but the central atom must be B.                                   
         For OUT,  the coordinate is the angle between the AB vector and        
              the plane containing the angle C-B-D.  The coordinate is          
              positive if A is on the same side of the plane as the             
              vector BC X BD.  Note that the central atom comes second          
              here and that C and D can be exchanged but that this              
              changes the sign of the coordinate.                               
         For TORS, the coordinate is defined as the angle between the           
              planes ABC and BCD.  Note that ABCD and DCBA are                  
              equivalent.                                                       
         For LIN1, the coordinate is the collinear bending of the linear        
              chain of atoms ABC in the the plane which contains D.  The        
              sign is positive if A and C move towards D.                       
         For LIN2, the coordinate is the bending of ABC perpendicular to        
              the plane which contains D.  The sign is positive if A and        
              C move in the direction of the vector product BD X BA.

           is the first optimization cycle), then an approximation to           
           the internal coordinate force constant matrix is read in:

           Each row of the force constant matrix is read up to and              
           including the diagonal element.  Each row begins on a new            
           line.                                                                
                                                                                
           Don't be put off by the requirement of a force constant              
           matrix.  If you know nothing about the system being studied,         
           just use values of 3.0 - 8.0 (for stretching coordinates) and        
           1.0 (for bending coordinates) for the diagonal force                 
           constants, and leave the rest zero.  If experimental force           
           constants are used, they should be scaled by 1.1 .                   
           For transition structure optimizations, it is important to           
           start with an analytical Hessian (calculated, perhaps, at a          
           very low level of theory).

  A. INTDER performs general curvilinear transformations among higher           
     order derivatives (Cartesian <---> internal) and may be used to            
     calculate vibrational frequency analyses in either internal or             
     Cartesian coordinates.  The internal coordinates used may be either        
     simple coordinates or symmetrized combinations.

           It is not necessary to use all 3N-6 internal coordinates when

           complete symmetry blocks (i.e. work out how many normal modes        
           there are of a particular symmetry and then you need to have         
           the same number of non-redundant symmetry internal

                         BMAT in the appropriate place.                         
                         This is useful if one wishes to obtain an initial      
                         force constant matrix at a low level of theory         
                         for subsequent use in a high level optimization.       
                         The force constants in BMAT are overwritten.           
                         Thus, if it is a new BMAT file, it is important        
                         to set it up with the appropriate number of            
                         blank lines for the force constant matrix.             
                         Also, make sure that the number of internal            
                         coordinates used in INTDER and BMAT is the             
                         same.

  A. FORM15 may be used as an alternative to the VIBLRG program.                
     A symmetry unique set of Cartesian coordinate gradients is used            
     (the molecular point group should be D2h or its subgroups).                
     The second derivatives are written in standard format to FILE15,           
     which can then be used with the NORMCO program to calculate the            
     vibrational frequencies.

1 Appendix II:   Index of files used by PSI                                     
  =========================================                                     
                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                
 a.      The programs that make up PSI are written in Fortran and use           
     logical unit numbers 3 to 99 for their input and output.  Apart            
     from a few exceptions, PSI uses the convention that the file               
     attached to logical unit "n" has a generic filetype called FILEn.          
     For example, the file attached to logical unit 42 is called FILE42.        
     The exceptions are CHECK (logical unit 3) and INPUT (logical unit          
     5).                                                                        
                                                                                
 b.      Logical units 2 to 29 are used for formatted files, while              
     30 to 99 are used for binary files.

                        like: what binary files are being opened, what
